ðŸ©º Heart Stroke Prediction Web App

A Machine Learningâ€“powered Streamlit web application that predicts the likelihood of a person having a heart stroke based on health-related data.

This project demonstrates how data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model comparison can be used to support early stroke risk prediction in healthcare analytics.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Interactive Web Interface â€” built with Streamlit for easy, no-code predictions.
âœ… Dropdown Inputs â€” users select from predefined options (no manual typing).
âœ… Automatic Data Cleaning â€” irrelevant columns like id are removed.
âœ… Model Training & Evaluation â€” trains and compares RandomForest & XGBoost models.
âœ… Performance Metrics â€” displays accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
âœ… Instant Predictions â€” outputs whether a person is at risk of heart stroke (0 or 1).

ðŸ“Š Model Performance
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1 Score
RandomForest	0.951	0.500	0.020	0.038
XGBoost	0.939	0.227	0.100	0.139

Note: The dataset is imbalanced â€” future improvements will focus on increasing recall using resampling techniques (e.g. SMOTE).
